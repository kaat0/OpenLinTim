Please make sure that your shell's CLASSPATH and PATH variables
are set properly to include the java interface and the executables
of the Xpress and/or Gurobi solvers.

For example, the following code can be added to ~/.profile
to achieve this:

  source /usr/local/xpressmp/bin/xpvars.sh

  export GUROBI_HOME="/home/user/gurobi"
  export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"
  export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="${GUROBI_HOME}/gurobi.lic"
  export CLASSPATH="${CLASSPATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib/gurobi.jar"
