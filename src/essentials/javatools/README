This README file describes the JavaTools file organization.

The directory src/ contains the JavaTools source, which, as the name says, is
written in Java and thus consists of packages.

net.lintim.callback
    Callback functions for gurobi and cplex solvers.
net.lintim.csv
    semiColon Separated Value readers/writers.
net.lintim.debug
    Initial duration assumption, event activity resp. public transportation
    network paths access.
net.lintim.dump
    Write progress to console.
net.lintim.evaluator
    Evaluate different quantities for the PTN, OD, LC, line pool, EAN and
    timetable.
net.lintim.exception
    DataInconsistentException class, the standard exception within JavaTools.
net.lintim.generator
    Contains the main logic for event activity network and passenger
    distribution generation as well as all solver interfaces.
net.lintim.graph
    Customized in-JavaTools graph library.
net.lintim.graphviz
    Draw event activity networks and timetables.
net.lintim.main
    All main methods. When a makefile target is called that uses JavaTools,
    it redirects to runner.sh and latter runs the main method from the
    respective class.
net.lintim.model
    Stations, Links (a.k.a. edges), the PTN, OD, line pool/concept, Events,
    Activities, the EAN, roughly said all network modeling relevant classes.
net.lintim.util
    Custom container classes like Bi- and TriLinkedHashMap as well as some
