shortest_paths
==============

Calculates shortest paths. 

Basic graph implementation to efficiently compute shortest paths. The design
goals are:

1. Speed.
2. No learning curve.
3. Manual control possible.

There are three interfaces at the moment: a C++, a Java and a shell interface.

For more info on the C++ interface, see "shortest_paths.h".

For more info on the shell interface, type

make shortest_paths_sh
shortest_paths_sh -h

Example:

shortest_paths_sh -n nodes.csv -e edges.csv -d distances.csv -p paths.csv

For the Java interface, see ./src directory, especially 
ShortestPathsTest.java, should be self explaining, especially with a proper
IDE like eclipse (buy yourself more RAM, it's cheap those days!). Consult
shortest_paths.h for ideologic help. If you want to get it run, see Makefile
and/or try

make shortest_paths_java_test
