## Logs

This folder contains log files produced by the lintim core. The filenames have the following structure:

`lintim_language_number1_number2.log`, where `language` is the programming language, `number1` is an increasing number (default up until 4) to store more than one log and `number2` is a specific number to ensure uniqueness of a log file.
