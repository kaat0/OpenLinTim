The files of this folder cannot be run directly from here, but have to be copied to the right 
places. That is in case of Bahn klein:

The Configuration files into datasets/
plotskript.sh into datasets/bahn-01/
run.sh, evskript.sh, shorten.cpp into datasets/bahn-01/Plot_skript/

Compile shorten.cpp to the executable shorten.
Create datasets/bahn-01/Plot_skript/Plot_x_y/ for x=1,..,4, y=1,..,2
Run plotskript.sh first to get the timetable data, then run.sh to format it appropriately.

As writing out the timetable of every iteration is not a standard feature of the modulo network 
simplex algorithm, use the altered modulo_network_simplex.cpp of this folder instead.
